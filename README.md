## Apple Wireless Keyboard Tech Specs
* (A1314) MC184LL/A On October 20, 2009, the aluminum model was updated so that two AA batteries are needed instead of three; two changes occurred in the physical appearance: 1. the placement of the plastic window for the bluetooth transceiver, which moved from the right-hand side of the keyboard's bottom to the centre, and 2. the keyboard was a few millimeters wider in depth than the previous wireless keyboard. Like the Magic Mouse released on the same date, it requires Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later.

* (A1016) Introduced for the first time in 2003, it was based on the Bluetooth standard. It was essentially identical to the revised Apple Keyboard offered four months earlier. According to the Apple website, it is not compatible with iPads, unlike later models.

## Information
